                <h2>DIRECTOR OF HERO ASSOCIATION FOUND DEAD, MURDER SUSPECTED</h2>

                <p><strong>NORTH STAR, THE FOUNDER AND CONTEMPORARY</strong> director of the Hero Association, has allegedly been found dead in her office today in a statement released by the Hero Association. Local authorities are currently undergoing homicide investigations.

                <p>North Star, most well known for her role as the face of the Hero Association and the number one superhero in Eastport, is often credited with single-handedly shaping hero culture into the way we think of it today. Since founding the Hero Association, she has stood as perhaps the icon of superheroism itself across the country and the world.

                <p>Though not yet confirmed, her death seems to follow the disturbing trend of disappearances that have plagued the members of the superpowered population of Eastport in recent months.

                <p>In her wake, the two Vice Directors of the Hero Association, Saint and the White Dragon, will be filling her position at the head of the organization as a temporary measure. Neither of them could be reached for further comment at this time.

                <p>[ ... ]</P>

                <h2>MISSING CHRISTMAS EVE CHILDREN FOUND SAFE BY SANTA</h2>
                <p><strong>TWAS THE NIGHT BEFORE CHRISTMAS</strong> and all through the house not a creature was stirring... and that was never a good sign in the Al-Qamar household. Their little bundle of joy was more excited than anyone to stay up all night waiting for Mr. Claus, so when Mrs. Al-Qamar stopped hearing little Seif running around in his room upstairs they were instantly worried.

                <p>"He's never quiet," the tearful mother explains. "He's always been the opiniated sort. He used to start arguments with his teddy bears- and he swore this year he was going to prove Santa wasn't real. And so when we opened his room to find him gone..." She trails off, too choked to go on any more.

                <p>Unfortunately for little Seif, Santa Claus was very much real- and he was on the job in an instant. Children had been disappearing in droves all that evening, a chilling omen for what was supposed to be the eve of the most cheerful holiday around.
